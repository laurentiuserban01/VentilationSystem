Overview:

  The scope of the project involved learning how automation solutions are ordered, developed and implemented in a real-world, market environment. To simulate this, the assistant teachers divided students into two groups: Automation Orderers and Solution Providers; our group served as solution providers to orderers Jere _ and Juho _ .
  
Approach:

  -Designing the automation request by the orderers and providing Requirement Specifications.
  
  -Initial analysis and discussion, followed by early designs
  
  -Settling on a common design that convenes for both parties
  
  -Implementing TIA software and running simulations/hardware tests
  
  -Providing the finished solution to the Orderer group.
  
This repository will host the project files for the TIA Portal application as well as other adjacent files such as the FAT report.
